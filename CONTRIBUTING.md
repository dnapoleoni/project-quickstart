Thanks for checking out this project! It was basically just a small quickstart project to save myself time, but figured I might as well make it public.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dnapoleoni/project-quickstart.git
   cd project-quickstart
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Code Style

- Formatting rules in .prettierrc
- ESLint rules in .eslintrc.cjs
- Tailwind theme in src/stlyes/theme.css, just a few basics to get started

## Submitting Changes

If you want to propose an improvement:
- Fork the repo and create a new branch
- Follow existing file structure and conventions
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing
- Submit a pull request and hope for the best

## Reporting Issues
